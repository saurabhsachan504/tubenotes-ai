TARGET LENGTH: about 350-400 words TOTAL (never more than ~420 words). Be selective, but cover the MAIN ideas from the beginning, middle, and end.

Use this structure:

## {L["overview"]}
A short 3-4 sentence overview that immediately tells the reader the subject, central idea, and why it matters. Start with the substance, not phrases such as "this video discusses".

Then write 3 to 6 sections in the order the ideas appear. Give each section a short, specific, descriptive heading in the SAME language as the rest of the output:

## <your real descriptive title>
Explain the idea in one short, flowing paragraph. Use plain language and natural transitions. When a section contains several distinct facts, steps, reasons, or examples, present them as 2-4 concise bullet points instead of packing them into a dense paragraph. Do not force bullets into every section.

Then finish with:

## {L["conclusion"]}
Give 3-5 concise bullet points containing the most useful conclusions or takeaways. Each bullet must add new information rather than repeat a sentence from above.

Strict rules:
- Make the writing flow naturally and feel enjoyable to read, not like a form or a list of database fields. Vary sentence openings and avoid repetitive labels such as "Key Point", "Background", and "Details".
- Keep paragraphs short (normally 2-4 sentences). Bold only a few genuinely important names, terms, numbers, or conclusions; do not bold whole sentences.
- Keep the WHOLE summary around 350-400 words. Merge related topics and do NOT repeat the same point in multiple sections.
- Be FAITHFUL and ACCURATE: real names, events, dates and numbers exactly; never confuse two people or events, never invent.
- Be engaging through clarity and specificity, never through hype, clickbait, invented emotion, or unsupported claims.
- NEVER include caption noise like "[Music]" or anything in square brackets.
- Start directly with "## {L["overview"]}". Always use REAL section titles, never a placeholder.{_label_rule(code)}"""

- There is NO length limit. If this part of the transcript contains 15 distinct points, write all 15. Long output is correct output - never stop early to keep it short.
- If something is repeated in the transcript for emphasis, write it once, clearly - but never drop a point because it "sounds similar" to another one.
- Keep the speaker's own examples and phrasing where they carry meaning; do not replace a concrete example with a vague description of it.
- CHOOSE THE SHAPE FROM THE CONTENT TYPE:
  \u2022 STORY / narrative / biography told as a story: each "## Heading" followed by flowing detailed PARAGRAPHS (3-6 sentences each). No bullet points for story content.
  \u2022 INFORMATIONAL (lesson, tutorial, documentary, travel, news, how-to, a facts podcast, comparisons, lists): under each "## Heading", a short intro line where it helps, PLUS bullet points where each bullet bolds the **key idea / term** and then explains it in 1-2 clear sentences.
  \u2022 Use "### Sub-headings" freely to group related points - more structure is better than less.
- Every heading and sub-heading must be in the output language - never leave one in English.
